* JitHub is a CLI (Command Line Interface) Address Book application *written in OOP fashion*. It has a very basic GUI.
* It is a Java application intended for busy students to schedule their meetings and view their calenders by entering natural language commands.
* It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* than what students
usually write in data structure modules.
* It has also included *additional features* based on Addressbook Level 3.

*What's different from the original Addressbook Level 3*

* Humours are added in JitHub.
